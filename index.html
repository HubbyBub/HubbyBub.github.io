								<h1>Andrew Zhang</h1>
								<p>Student ID:s3786306 Email: s3786306@student.rmit.edu.au</br>
								<p>Hi! I'm Andrew and here's some information about me!
								I am a full-blooded Chinese but I was born here in Melbourne.
								As of now, the highest level of education I have received is undergrad at RMIT for IT.
								I can speak English and my Chinese is at a pretty high level however, compared to first language speakers
								I could probably use some help, I understand about 80% of most conversations so I'll be able to pitch in. </br>
								I really love exercise, this includes most sports such as Tennis and Soccer, but I especially enjoy going to the gym.
								I started going to the gym in year 7, which is not considered safe since I was only 13 years old.

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Where it all Began</Strong></br>
								To uncover my interest in IT, I have to go back to when I was in year 5 when I got my first iPod touch, it was a marvel of mystery as well as a shock to what IT could be and become. The thing was huge, heavy, clunky, couldn’t make phone calls, yet it loved it so much. I remember there was a game called ‘TalkingCarl’ and
								all it did was repeat what you said but in a higher pitch and I found it hilarious, making it swear and say dumb things. Another was a fake beer drinking app which made it look like you were drinking beer. Back then I didn’t know what it was, but that was the spark of my interest in all thing IT. </p>
								<p><strong>Why Choose RMIT?</strong></br>
								The main reason I came to RMIT was that I couldn’t get into science at Melbourne University, my dream university, but like dreams, they don’t always become reality. I understood that RMIT was the scope of my capabilities, so I didn’t complain when I came here. At first, it was bad, the social pressure and expectations 
								not being met ruined me when I finished high school. For 3 whole months, I felt the overwhelming judgement from my classmates and parents. Having been tutored, doing work but still not doing well enough to achieve my goals put me on another level of sadness. It was difficult, but I put a smile on my face to not dishearten my
								parents. Eventually, I got through it and started coming to RMIT, and I decided to pursue my interests in IT. I thought that since RMIT stands for ‘Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology’, I assumed that RMIT would be the best option for Technology(I also didn’t really a choice). But not that I’m here, I love it. Everything 
								about RMIT is great, the lecture rooms are spacey, the lecturers are nice and concise. The design is modern and the location is amazing. I’ve gotten over my regrets and had come to RMIT with a clean slate in hopes of doing well academically as well as meet new people. </p>
								<p><strong>What do I Expect</strong></br>
								I expect that over my years here at RMIT, I hope to learn how to not only create useful programs but also be able to fully develop good knowledge and sense of how IT is used in the world around me. I was particularly intrigued by the User Design Course. Before the class, I had never really understood what user experience 
								or UDC was. All I could recognise was that sometimes programs were difficult to navigate. So, from that, I expect to learn to spot poor UX software, be able to create/improve the user experience. Additionally, be able to create websites and protect myself from security breaches in my computer and online profiles.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/TeslaJob.jpg" alt="Tesla Automation Job" /></span>
								<p><strong>What makes it appealing to me</strong></br>
								For me this would me my <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Job/fremont-automation-engineer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,7_IC1147355_KO8,27.htm?rdserp=true&jl=3100735133&jaguid=&src=GD_JOB_AD&srs=EI_JOBS&s=21&ao=374997">Ideal Job.</a>
								When I first saw Tesla’s auto drive, I was astonished at its capabilities and was instantly attracted to the idea of a car that had the capability to drive you home. I think in the future that a lot of things around the world would become automated. Having transport become the first, I believe is a huge leap into the future, 
								is incredible. I think if I could start working in the automation industry, it would cover a huge range of what I would need to learn for the future. This would prepare me to become more adaptable in the future. Especially with the soon expected life on mars, where for now, all things are automated. 
								</p>
								<p><strong>Job Description</strong></br>
								The job itself is what I believe the product of the IT course. It requires the developer to have at least 5 years of experience with testing on automation frameworks as well as testing of management tools for CI/CD, for example, they recommend the Jenkins software found in Java. It does require a master of computer science or
								something else related. To have an excellent understanding of data structures and algorithms, to be committed to writing plenty of high-quality software. Have a good fundamental understanding of QA concepts, terminology and lifecycles. The good thing is it requires a minimum of 5 years of experience of languages such as go, 
								Python or Java to which I have already started. Heavy understanding and experience with developing scripts using shell, Perl or something similar. Knowledge of working with a full-development lifecycle of large-scale industrial or service based applications. Finally, experience with the Linux system including network configuration, 
								web technologies, system settings, common commands/utilities. </P>
								<p><strong>Experience I have</strong></br>
								Currently, I’m passionate but still new to the world of IT. I have only a couple months of experience with a language (java) and some basic knowledge with python. I have little to no experience with Linux. </p>
								<p><strong>What I can do</strong></br>
								Firstly, I believe I should figure out what the terms that the job required mean. Besides that, utilising the most of RMIT would be the best thing, for now, making sure I never miss a lecture and always do the work that is requested of me. To keep up to date is probably the hardest thing for me to do right now since I find everything 
								very hard. I started to also use some external learning services such as code academy to learn more about languages and have also downloaded a Linux operating software on my computer so I can dabble with it. I’ve also been going to CSIT for help and getting to learn more from the sophomores and third years on the side. This has been very
								enlightening to me as well as helpful in better understanding the lectures. I try and meet new people who have had more experience with IT or anything IT related. So far I’ve met many nice and helpful people that are willing to spare me their time so I can gather a better understanding of coding and the general stuff.</P>

								<P><strong>Myer-Briggs Test</strong></br>
								Based on the Myer-Briggs Test, My mind is more extraverted 69% to 31% Introverted, and “This trait determines how we interact with our environment.” My energy is more Intuitive 60% to 40% observant, and “This trait shows where we direct our mental energy”. My nature learns towards feelings 72% to 28% thinking, and “This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions.”. My Tactics are
								more prospecting 63% to 37% judging, and “This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision-making.” My identity is more turbulent 51% to 49% assertive, and “This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions.” In summary, I’m a campaigner (ENFP, -A/-T), “It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for – and if 
								you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool – for love – for your dreams – for the adventure of being alive.” – Oriah Mountain Dreamer, is the quote they provided for me. Generally, it defines me as a “true free spirit”. Says I am the life of the party, but isn’t the type who’s interested in the “ the 
								sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment,” rather I am more engaged in “social and emotional connections (I) make with others”. It calls me “charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that (we) compromise can certainly be felt in any crowd.” With such complementary titles as “You can change the world with an Idea” or “don’t lose that ‘little spark of madness”.
								Being a campaigner aligns me with people such as, “Robert Downey Jr, Will Smith, Robin Williams, Drew Barrymore, Russel brand” and etc. </p>
								<p>A campaigners strength are curiosity, being observant, energic. Being an expert communicators, knowing how to relax very popular and friendly. However, they have poor practical skills, find it difficult to focus,  overthink things, get stressed easily, highly emotional and are independent to a fault.</p>
								<p>In terms of friendships for campaigners, they are “cheerful and supportive”. Having friends who are more outgoing but “campaigners will also go to great lengths and be surprisingly persistent in their efforts to know more reserved personalities.” The good things about campaigners is they are “open – minded and sincere enough in their friendships, can connect with and understand even their acquaintances well enough.</p>
								<p>For campaigners, they are fascinated by new ideas for both their field of expertise as well as new subjects along the way. Having a campaigners personality is to “propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go.” Their people skill is “a quality that is even more valuable now than ever.” Having this quality means that “even as they explore new challenges on their own, they will be able to work 
								with others.” This also means, “People with the Campaigner personality type need to feel like they’re pushing boundaries and exploring ideas.” </p>
								<P><Strong> Learning Style Test</Strong></br>
								For the Learning style test, I scored Auditory: 35% Visual: 25% Tactile: 40%, meaning I'm a more tactile learner. being a tactile learner, learn more by touching and doing. I "understand and remember things through physical movement. (Being) a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn." Having this style of learning, I "like to take things apart and put things together, and  tend to find 
								reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored." I will often " communicate by touching, and appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back." </p>
