								<h1>Andrew Zhang</h1>
								<p>Student ID:s3786306 Email: s3786306@student.rmit.edu.au</br>
								<p>Hi! I'm Andrew and here's some information about me!
								I am a full-blooded Chinese but I was born here in Melbourne.
								As of now, the highest level of education I have received is undergrad at RMIT for IT.
								I can speak English and my Chinese is at a pretty high level however, compared to first language speakers
								I could probably use some help, I understand about 80% of most conversations so I'll be able to pitch in. </br>
								I really love exercise, this includes most sports such as Tennis and Soccer, but I especially enjoy going to the gym.
								I started going to the gym in year 7, which is not considered safe since I was only 13 years old.

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Tesla.jpg" alt="Tesla Auto Drive" width="400" height="300" /></span>
								<p><strong>Where it all Began</Strong></br>
								To uncover my interest in IT, I have to go back to when I was in year 5 when I got my first iPod touch, it was a marvel of mystery as well as a shock to what IT could be and become. The thing was huge, heavy, clunky, couldn’t make phone calls, yet it loved it so much. I remember there was a game called ‘TalkingCarl’ and
								all it did was repeat what you said but in a higher pitch and I found it hilarious, making it swear and say dumb things. Another was a fake beer drinking app which made it look like you were drinking beer. Back then I didn’t know what it was, but that was the spark of my interest in all thing IT. </p>
								<p><strong>Why Choose RMIT?</strong></br>
								The main reason I came to RMIT was that I couldn’t get into science at Melbourne University, my dream university, but like dreams, they don’t always become reality. I understood that RMIT was the scope of my capabilities, so I didn’t complain when I came here. At first, it was bad, the social pressure and expectations 
								not being met ruined me when I finished high school. For 3 whole months, I felt the overwhelming judgement from my classmates and parents. Having been tutored, doing work but still not doing well enough to achieve my goals put me on another level of sadness. It was difficult, but I put a smile on my face to not dishearten my
								parents. Eventually, I got through it and started coming to RMIT, and I decided to pursue my interests in IT. I thought that since RMIT stands for ‘Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology’, I assumed that RMIT would be the best option for Technology(I also didn’t really a choice). But not that I’m here, I love it. Everything 
								about RMIT is great, the lecture rooms are spacey, the lecturers are nice and concise. The design is modern and the location is amazing. I’ve gotten over my regrets and had come to RMIT with a clean slate in hopes of doing well academically as well as meet new people. </p>
								<p><strong>What do I Expect</strong></br>
								I expect that over my years here at RMIT, I hope to learn how to not only create useful programs but also be able to fully develop good knowledge and sense of how IT is used in the world around me. I was particularly intrigued by the User Design Course. Before the class, I had never really understood what user experience 
								or UDC was. All I could recognise was that sometimes programs were difficult to navigate. So, from that, I expect to learn to spot poor UX software, be able to create/improve the user experience. Additionally, be able to create websites and protect myself from security breaches in my computer and online profiles.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/TeslaJob.jpg" alt="Tesla Automation Job" /></span>
								<p><strong>What makes it appealing to me</strong></br>
								For me this would me my <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Job/fremont-automation-engineer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,7_IC1147355_KO8,27.htm?rdserp=true&jl=3100735133&jaguid=&src=GD_JOB_AD&srs=EI_JOBS&s=21&ao=374997">Ideal Job.</a>
								When I first saw Tesla’s auto drive, I was astonished at its capabilities and was instantly attracted to the idea of a car that had the capability to drive you home. I think in the future that a lot of things around the world would become automated. Having transport become the first, I believe is a huge leap into the future, 
								is incredible. I think if I could start working in the automation industry, it would cover a huge range of what I would need to learn for the future. This would prepare me to become more adaptable in the future. Especially with the soon expected life on mars, where for now, all things are automated. 
								</p>
								<p><strong>Job Description</strong></br>
								The job itself is what I believe the product of the IT course. It requires the developer to have at least 5 years of experience with testing on automation frameworks as well as testing of management tools for CI/CD, for example, they recommend the Jenkins software found in Java. It does require a master of computer science or
								something else related. To have an excellent understanding of data structures and algorithms, to be committed to writing plenty of high-quality software. Have a good fundamental understanding of QA concepts, terminology and lifecycles. The good thing is it requires a minimum of 5 years of experience of languages such as go, 
								Python or Java to which I have already started. Heavy understanding and experience with developing scripts using shell, Perl or something similar. Knowledge of working with a full-development lifecycle of large-scale industrial or service based applications. Finally, experience with the Linux system including network configuration, 
								web technologies, system settings, common commands/utilities. </P>
								<p><strong>Experience I have</strong></br>
								Currently, I’m passionate but still new to the world of IT. I have only a couple months of experience with a language (java) and some basic knowledge with python. I have little to no experience with Linux. </p>
								<p><strong>What I can do</strong></br>
								Firstly, I believe I should figure out what the terms that the job required mean. Besides that, utilising the most of RMIT would be the best thing, for now, making sure I never miss a lecture and always do the work that is requested of me. To keep up to date is probably the hardest thing for me to do right now since I find everything 
								very hard. I started to also use some external learning services such as code academy to learn more about languages and have also downloaded a Linux operating software on my computer so I can dabble with it. I’ve also been going to CSIT for help and getting to learn more from the sophomores and third years on the side. This has been very
								enlightening to me as well as helpful in better understanding the lectures. I try and meet new people who have had more experience with IT or anything IT related. So far I’ve met many nice and helpful people that are willing to spare me their time so I can gather a better understanding of coding and the general stuff.</P>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Camp.jpg" alt="Campaigner Personality"	width="400" height="500" /></span>
								<P><strong>Myer-Briggs Test</strong></br>
								Based on the Myer-Briggs Test, My mind is more extraverted 69% to 31% Introverted, and “This trait determines how we interact with our environment.” My energy is more Intuitive 60% to 40% observant, and “This trait shows where we direct our mental energy”. My nature learns towards feelings 72% to 28% thinking, and “This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions.”. My Tactics are
								more prospecting 63% to 37% judging, and “This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision-making.” My identity is more turbulent 51% to 49% assertive, and “This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions.” In summary, I’m a campaigner (ENFP, -A/-T), “It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for – and if 
								you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool – for love – for your dreams – for the adventure of being alive.” – Oriah Mountain Dreamer, is the quote they provided for me. Generally, it defines me as a “true free spirit”. Says I am the life of the party, but isn’t the type who’s interested in the “ the 
								sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment,” rather I am more engaged in “social and emotional connections (I) make with others”. It calls me “charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that (we) compromise can certainly be felt in any crowd.” With such complementary titles as “You can change the world with an Idea” or “don’t lose that ‘little spark of madness”.
								Being a campaigner aligns me with people such as, “Robert Downey Jr, Will Smith, Robin Williams, Drew Barrymore, Russel brand” and etc. </p>
								<p>A campaigners strength are curiosity, being observant, energic. Being an expert communicators, knowing how to relax very popular and friendly. However, they have poor practical skills, find it difficult to focus,  overthink things, get stressed easily, highly emotional and are independent to a fault.</p>
								<p>In terms of friendships for campaigners, they are “cheerful and supportive”. Having friends who are more outgoing but “campaigners will also go to great lengths and be surprisingly persistent in their efforts to know more reserved personalities.” The good things about campaigners is they are “open – minded and sincere enough in their friendships, can connect with and understand even their acquaintances well enough.</p>
								<p>For campaigners, they are fascinated by new ideas for both their field of expertise as well as new subjects along the way. Having a campaigners personality is to “propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go.” Their people skill is “a quality that is even more valuable now than ever.” Having this quality means that “even as they explore new challenges on their own, they will be able to work 
								with others.” This also means, “People with the Campaigner personality type need to feel like they’re pushing boundaries and exploring ideas.” </p>
								<P><Strong> Learning Style Test</Strong></br>
								For the Learning style test, I scored Auditory: 35% Visual: 25% Tactile: 40%, meaning I'm a more tactile learner. being a tactile learner, learn more by touching and doing. I "understand and remember things through physical movement. (Being) a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn." Having this style of learning, I "like to take things apart and put things together, and  tend to find 
								reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored." I will often " communicate by touching, and appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back." </p>
								<p><strong>Big Five Personalities</strong></br>
								For the Big Five personalities test on extroversion/Surgency/Positive Emotionality, I scored a high of 90% meaning I'm "outgoing and social." For emotional stability/Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality I scored a 66% since Neuroticism is actually the opposite of emotional stability, I scored a 66% meaning I'm more emotionally stable and don't tend to have mood swings or negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, worry, 
								fear, envy, frustration and loneliness. For Agreeableness, I scored a 76%, having high agreeableness equates to being "friendly and optimistic. " For Conscientiousness, I scored a meager 57%, since its still higher than 50%, it means I'm "careful and diligent" however, I could learn to be more so. Finally, Its  Intellect/Imagination, I scored a 65% meaning I'm more "Open to Experience" and less likely to be "traditional and conventional". From this test, I can see how the other test 
								correlate and respond to each other, generally, in a work environment, I'll lean towards being a social worker or PR. Making connections and meeting new people since I scored lower on the test for carefulness and diligence. </P>
								<P><strong> What do these test mean to you</strong></br>
								For me, these tests are a guideline as well as places where I can trace my flaws and hopefully better myself in the future.  I see them as an opportunity to flourish in my strengths as well as build on my flaws. I believe these tests have been pretty accurate and he inspired me to better myself for my own sake as well as the sake of my friends and family who have put their faith and hopes In me.</p>
								<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></br>
								Since I work well in a team, I think having these skills will not only assist in getting the team to work well together but also to allow for a good flow of new ideas. When tackling a problem, I think we would approach it better, not as one against another but as a team against the problem. I believe my social skills will benefit the group though gathering of ideas and keeping the team together. Not necessary taking charge of everyone but rather keeping the group in control and staying on track so that we complete the task with utmost efficiency. </p>
								<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></br>
								When forming the team, I believe I'd be able to get even the least likely to help person to assist in the way only they can. I'd like to look for people who are equally sociable but more so people who are gritty and can do their work diligently, knowing that I scored less in these fields, I'd like to have good cooperation with someone who ability in that field far surpasses mine so that we mutually beneficial whilst getting all our work done and done well. Of course, I'd hate to not do anything besides getting people motivated so I would also put in my maximum
								effort into doing and learning as much as I can from those who are more experienced than I. That way I could also improve on where I lack.</P>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee Statistics" /></span>
								<p><strong>Project Idea</strong></br>
									I’d like to build a smart phone app as I believe that the one thing that people generally always keep on them is a phone. For my idea it would be an app that allows you to order drinks before you get to the store. Essentially, you leave a keep cup or use paper cup but you pre order your drinks so that shops can avoid a queue and people don’t line up during peak hour to get their coffee’s. This would be especially useful for university students who have lectures early in the morning and cannot afford to get drinks or they’d be late for class.</p>
								<p><strong>Motivation</strong></br>
								The idea behind the project is that, since people generally buy coffee in the morning, there is a rush hour to get coffee. This also means huge lines and impatient people who need to get to work or university. According to <a href= "https://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry-trends/market-research-reports/accommodation-food-services/cafes-coffee-shops.html">IBIS world </a> , Australia coffee market is set to keep on increasing, and is said to be valued at “9.8 billion”. This gives us an indication that Australians like their coffee, thus proving that there 
								is to be expected delays in which lines would unmotivated the busy people who need their morning coffee fix, that is terrible as it would mean a loss in customers and creates loss in revenue for coffee shops. Also, since coffee shops have so many coffee options, if we apply hicks law, It would take even longer for people to order their drinks and as a result also delay cash turnover, meaning further loss in revenue. We can apply this to when university students want to buy coffee, If they choose to buy a coffee before class, they will risk missing the
								start of their lectures with is not ideal. However, if they decide to buy it later, they risk waiting long queues due to the overflow of consumers for the coffee shop.
								 Also, a study by <a href="www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/"> Statisa </a> suggest that the amount of people who owns a smart phone
								will incease to 2.87 billion in 2020.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></br>
								The app would be used simply to order your drinks before you get there and a machine to keep your drinks hot while you get there. The idea behind it is to reduce the waiting that customers have when they want to get something to drink, this doesn’t just apply to coffee, you could order a milk tea, tea or even something similar of the sort. I would work like apps similar to uber eats or menu log, but rather than have it delivered it, it would be premade for you to get. This would also be a difference to such already existing app such as uber eats as it 
								would be targeted towards drinks shops and not restaurants or fast food places. It would allow you to select from the café’s/shops partnered with the app and order drinks while you were on your way to work or places where you regularly visit. I believe this would be ideal for university students or people who have to work early in the morning and are on a tight schedule. You would order that drink perhaps 10-20 minutes before you arrived and a tablet of some sort would alert the barista to prepare your drink for you. As you arrive and walk past the queue, 
								you’d show that it was indeed your order via a barcode scan or proof of purchase and the barista would hand you your drink. I think another thing that would be incorporated would be loyalty credits as well as frequent use of keep cups. You could leave your keep cups there, clean of course and the next time you order a drink, they just take out your keep cup and prepare a drink for you. I think this would take away some of the faults of the user since people would often not bother carrying a keep cup all day, but still want to reduce their waste. Having your
								favourite coffee place keep you keep cup would completely end this issue, and an ID sticker could be stuck to the keep cup to be used to keep track of their keep cup. This would be used to check if they have stored a keep cup at that particular shop.  Coffee shops often provide loyalty cards that offer a free cup of coffee every 8-10 cups of coffee they order from these coffee shops. Having these cards are a good idea as they promote consumers to continue using their facility. However, having to remember to bring this flimsy piece of paper could be troublesome 
								for some customers, having our app keep track would firstly reduce this stress as mentioned above, the smartphone market is still increasing, as well as reduce the amount of paper that is being wasted on these cards. </p>
								<p><strong> Tools and Technology </strong></br>
								In terms of tool and technology that would be required, You would need a smartphone. Using an app builder program would be the best place to start. Using a computer would be sufficient in creating an app. There are plenty of resources online that could be used to begin the process of app creation. But I think learning to make one from the group up would be the best in terms of developing knowledge. There are website such as <a href="https://www.appypie.com/"> AppyPie</a>, or to learn it by yourself, <a href="https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/how-to-build-app-from-scratch-beginner-programmer-7z0atq56w"> CodeMentor</a> would be a good place to start. </P>
								<p><strong>Skills Required</strong></br>
								It would require enough knowledge of how to make an app for smartphones to be put on app stores, such are Appstore or google play. For app creation such languages as Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, Go and C# would all be sufficient to be a starting place to creating apps. These are skills of which I am currently in the process of learning and preparing for the hopeful development of this app. Additionally, these languages are quite common and therefore, wouldn't be difficult to find someone with enough knowledge to create the app for me.</p> 
								<p><strong> Outcome</strong></br>
								If the project is complete, there should be little to no problems, the only condition is to get the name out into the public so it becomes a household app or something people want to use on the regular. If the project is to be determined as a success, it could conquer the drink world as uber eats has done so with food delivery.</P>
